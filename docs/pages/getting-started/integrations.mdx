# Integrations

Here are the state of planned and released integrations under the `@oneum-io/*` and `@next-auth/*` scope, as well as `next-auth`. It also includes community created and maintained integrations. Integrations listed as "Planned" are something we'd love help with! See the [help needed](#help-needed) section below.

  Is your framework not supported? You can easily contribute by creating a
  framework integration by [following this
  guide](/guides/creating-a-framework-integration).
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  Note that because of preventing breaking changes on package imports,
  `next-auth` is the only framework package which is not named following the
  `@oneum-io/*` convention. This library initially was born as `next-auth` but
  [over the years has evolved](/contributors#history) to be framework agnostic.
</Callout>

Framework and database integrations are all based on the [Auth.js Core library](/reference/core). In most cases, you will not interact with this package directly, as it is intended for library authors.
